This is a basic game card to show my programming skills

The idea behind this website is to show how I code, using:

- Python
- Flask (with sessions)
- Websockets
- SQL lite
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS (Bootstrap mostly)

- Register (very simple user and password).

- Create a card (you can also upload a photo if you like).

- Fight with any other user that is connected at the same time.

To be able to use the app you have to set a variable 'KEY'

If you like to add one Admin, you can only do it manually accesing to the database ('1' is admin)
